php-git - v0.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project provides PHP bindings for libgit2. The extension dynamically links
to libgit2 installed in the usual way on your system. We also expect the git2
headers to be installed in the usual locations.

Versioning

Since we do not bundle the libgit2 dependency, it up to the user to provide the
correct version of libgit2 required by their version of php-git. On Linux,
php-git has the libgit2 version soname embedded into it, so it should always
load the correct version. To avoid ambiguity, we have provided a listing of what
version of libgit2 covers php-git:

    php-git                 libgit2
    -------                 -------

    minimum                 v0.24.0

API Coverage

We document API coverage in the DOCS file, including the major differences
between the PHP userspace API and the original C library API. Please consult
this documentation before using these bindings, as there are some differences
that need to be understood.
