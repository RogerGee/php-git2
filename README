php-git2 - v0.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project provides PHP bindings for libgit2. The extension dynamically links
to libgit2 installed in the usual way on your system. We also expect the git2
headers to be installed in the usual locations.

Versioning

Since we do not bundle the libgit2 dependency, it up to the user to provide the
correct version of libgit2 required by their version of php-git2. On Linux,
php-git2 will have the soname of whatever git2 version you have installed
embedded into it, so it will always load the correct version. To avoid
ambiguity, we have provided a listing of the version of git2 covered by
php-git2:

    php-git2                libgit2         PHP
    --------                -------         ---

    current                 v0.25.1         >=5.4

API Coverage

We document API coverage in the DOCS file, including the major differences
between the PHP userspace API and the original C library API. Please consult
this documentation before using these bindings, as there are some differences
that need to be understood.

The 'bindings' file contains a list of all bindings and whether they are covered
or not.

Please make sure to update these files when adding/updating functionality.

Building

This extension is written in C++, and it takes advantage of several C++11
features. You need to have a relatively recent C++ compiler that supports C++11
metaprogramming features. This extension has been built successfully using GCC
and clang on macOS and Linux. Experimental versions for PHP5 have been built on
Windows using MinGW (see section on Windows).

Build the extension in the normal way using autoconf and make. Ensure you build
the correct version of php-git2 corresponding to whatever git2 you have
installed on the system. If you want to static link git2 into the extension,
install the archive library for git2 in place of the dynamic link one (or alter
the config file to point at your static archive).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows

This project does not officially support Windows at this time, due to compiler
version requirements for PHP5 and inadaquete C++11 support in those
compilers. Experimental builds have been built with MinGW which work
successfully. However these builds required a lot of hacking and were designed
to only be used for testing, not production, environments.

If you are building for Windows, or using one of our experimental builds, make
sure that your git2 does not static link to the CRT. It needs to dynamic link to
the same runtime being used by php5 and php-git2.

In our experimental builds, we were able to successfully build php-git2.dll
using MinGW (though we had to hack the standard and PHP headers a little). The
resulting library linked against msvcr100.dll, and we built PHP 5.4 and
git2 with the VC100 tools.
